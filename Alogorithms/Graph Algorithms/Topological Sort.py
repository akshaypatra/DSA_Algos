'''
Topological Sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

ðŸ§  Intuition Behind DFS-Based Topological Sort

In DFS:

-> We go deep in the graph before backtracking.
-> Once we finish visiting all descendants of a node, we record that node (usually by adding it to a stack or list).
-> Since we visit all the dependencies before the node itself, the reverse of the finishing order gives the topological sort.
